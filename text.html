                                    primarily active in the charity sector.</li>
                                <li>Recruiters are able to post current vacancies of either paid jobs or volunteer roles
                                    that are searchable by Candidates to allow them to apply for such positions (Jobs).

                                    you, such as your full name and email address. That information must be true,
                                    complete and current, and you must ensure that you keep it up to date. You may not
                                    create an account with us using an assumed name or someone else’s identity.</li>

                                    Whenever you communicate with other Users in the context of the Service, you must
                                    not abuse or threaten them, use discriminatory language (such as racial slurs) to
                                    them, mislead them or make them promises you do not intend to keep. We reserve the

                                <li>Where another User shares with you in the context of the Service information which
                                    they describe as confidential, or which is obviously confidential, you must not
                                    share that information with anyone else without their permission, unless you are
                                    required to do so by law. You must not post any confidential information (whether
